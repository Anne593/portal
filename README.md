Pre-Configured Application Template for CakePHP 3

## Installation

Stuff like MySQL user and password is configured by using PHP Dotenv.
Be sure to set `SESSION_COOKIE_NAME` and `MAIN_DOMAIN` in the `.env`, as these values are mandatory for a correct session setup.
Also, rename `app.default.php` to `app.php` and change the settings fitting your needs.

Install plugins with `$ composer install`

Be sure to have `npm` installed and make sure afterwards `bower` is installed globally:

```
$ npm install -g bower
```

Now we have to install some npm packages and the bower dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

Install the bower dependencies:

`$ bower install`


Next, setup your database. We're using cakephp/migrations for that:

`$ bin/cake migrations migrate`

Now seed the database with a default user

`$ bin/cake migrations seed`
